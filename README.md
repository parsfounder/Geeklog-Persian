# Geeklog-Persian
Geeklog CMS Persian Translation

Geeklog is an open source application for managing dynamic web content. It is written in PHP and supports MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database backend.

"Out of the box", Geeklog is a CMS, or a blog engine with support for comments, trackbacks, multiple syndication formats, spam protection, and all the other vital features of such a system.

The core Geeklog distribution can easily be extended by the many community developed plugins and other add-ons to radically alter its functionality. Available plugins include forums, image galleries, and many more.
